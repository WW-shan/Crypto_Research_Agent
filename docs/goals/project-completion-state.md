# Project Completion State

This file is the working memory for the long-running Codex Goal defined in
`docs/goals/project-completion-goal.md`. Update it at the end of every completed
round.

## Current Round

- Round: 15
- Status: Phase 14 LLM-Native Autonomous Iteration Controller complete and
  verified in the implementation worktree
- Started: 2026-05-29
- Completed: 2026-05-29
- Active slice: Phase 14: LLM-Native Autonomous Iteration Controller
- Active plan source:
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-29-phase-14-llm-native-autonomous-iteration-controller.md`
- Phase report:
  `docs/goals/phase-reports/2026-05-29-phase-14-llm-native-autonomous-iteration-controller-completion-report.md`

## Completed This Round

- Ran Phase 14 Smart Search research for structured LLM outputs, AI agent
  guardrails, prompt-injection risk, GitHub Actions hardening, and agent
  evaluation. Search evidence is under
  `/tmp/smart-search-evidence/20260529-phase14-autonomous-iteration/`.
- Added the Phase 14 design spec and implementation plan.
- Added `build_iteration_cycle_report`, strict `IterationCandidate` models,
  and deterministic rejection for uncited evidence refs, direct code-write
  authority, missing required tests, missing source probe plans, live capital,
  live order routing, and charter violations.
- Added `render_iteration_cycle_markdown`.
- Added the `iteration-cycle` CLI command with fixed planning LLM role,
  Markdown artifact output, JSON artifact output, runtime metadata, and
  `auto_executes_changes=false`.
- Updated `docs/roadmap.md`, `docs/runbook.md`, and this state file to record
  that the first safe autonomy increment exists while the autonomous
  code-writing loop remains proposal-only and autonomous new data source
  discovery remains probe-gated.
- Added this round's Phase completion report.

## Verification Evidence

- Smart Search evidence:
  - `smart-search doctor --format json` returned `ok=true`.
  - `00-doctor.json`, `01-deep-plan.json`, `02-search-agent-safety.json`, and
    fetched source notes `03` through `08` are stored under the Phase 14
    evidence directory.
  - One OpenAI guardrails URL fetch failed, so the design used the available
    OpenAI, OWASP, and GitHub evidence already captured locally.
- Baseline worktree verification before Phase 14 code edits:
  `uv run --extra dev pytest -q` passed with 958 tests.
- TDD RED checks were observed for the missing controller module, missing
  Markdown renderer, missing CLI command, and missing Phase 14 documentation
  contract.
- Focused Phase 14 verification:
  `uv run --extra dev pytest tests/test_iteration_controller.py tests/test_iteration_cycle_cli.py tests/test_documentation_contract.py -q`
  passed with 16 tests.
- Full verification:
  `uv run --extra dev pytest -q` passed with 965 tests.
- `uv run --extra dev ruff check .` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Staged review before commit is required to include `git diff --cached
  --check`, `git diff --cached --name-only`, `git diff --cached --no-ext-diff
  --unified=0`, and
  `uv run python -m crypto_alpha_agent.security.secret_scan --staged --fail-on-empty-with-untracked`.

## Current Project Target

The prior Phase 13 completion state described a deterministic evidence factory.
The active next project line changes the runtime target: product commands must
be LLM-native and must not succeed through deterministic-only fallback.

The evidence factory now has execution-realistic paper simulation,
evidence-grounded AI research planning, and profit governance review active:

- public-data ingestion and local durable SQLite storage;
- typed OHLCV, funding, DEX, DeFi, and open-interest records;
- source-health records that distinguish route, provider reachability, parse
  status, typed rows, and blocked reasons;
- data-quality checks for source failures, stale records, gaps, duplicates,
  timestamp skew, and invalid values;
- three executable paper-simulated families:
  `funding_extremity_price_confirmation`,
  `funding_mean_reversion_after_extreme`, and
  `funding_open_interest_crowding`;
- three research-only watchlists:
  `defi_yield_regime_watchlist`, `dex_liquidity_volume_watchlist`, and
  `volatility_compression_expansion_watchlist`;
- Phase 10 paper execution realism with venue fee assumptions, min-notional and
  precision feasibility, stale-signal gating, funding alignment checks,
  missed/partial-fill modeling, `pre_cost_only_profitable` rejection, and
  evidence package summaries for notional, fees, slippage, stale signals, and
  fills;
- daily/weekly evidence reports, governance reports, paper simulation, memory,
  and rollout review artifacts with `live_execution_enabled=false`.
- AI research context, stricter experiment proposal guards, duplicate rejected
  experiment memory, design-only strategy template proposals, and weekly
  `ai-research-memo` artifacts.
- Phase 12 `governance-report` artifacts that classify families as
  `keep_collecting`, `stop`, `redesign_validator`, `add_data`, or
  `owner_decision_review` from validation, paper, source-health, cost, and
  memory evidence.
- Phase 7 `historical-bootstrap` artifacts that evaluate historical windows,
  report source collection/probe status, classify historical strategy results,
  and set forward 30/60/90 evidence targets without mutating forward evidence
  ledgers or stopped-family memory.
- Phase 13 read-only review artifacts that inspect generated reports, evidence
  packages, AI memos, strategy scoreboards, stopped-family ledgers, and
  finished artifacts, then record explicit family and major-cycle decisions
  tied to evidence references instead of AI narrative.

## Known Hard Boundaries

- No wallet keys.
- No wallet-key access.
- No live order routing.
- No exchange order submission.
- No order routing.
- No live execution.
- No live capital.
- No real-capital execution.
- No MEV, mempool, bridge-race, flash-loan, premium-RPC, private
  infrastructure, or speed-edge strategies.
- No secrets in git, logs, docs, memory, reports, screenshots, tests, or public
  GitHub.

## Known Remaining Gaps

The Phase 0 through Phase 13 charter-compliant evidence-factory roadmap is
implemented, verified, committed, and pushed. The LLM-native runtime follow-up
also removed deterministic-only product success paths.

Reality audit: `docs/goals/project-reality-audit-2026-05-29.md` records that
the owner's broader autonomy target is larger than the completed Phase 0
through Phase 13 roadmap. Relative to that owner autonomy target, these
implementation gaps remain:

- `iteration-cycle` now starts the closed auto-iteration loop by asking the
  configured real planning LLM for strict `IterationCandidate` records and
  guarding them against uncited evidence, missing tests, missing source probes,
  direct code-write authority, live capital, and live order routing.
- autonomous code-writing loop remains proposal-only;
- autonomous new data source discovery remains probe-gated beyond the curated
  source-probe and query catalogs;
- accepted iteration candidates still require human review and separate TDD
  implementation before any source, strategy, experiment, or code-change
  candidate can become product code.

Operational evidence collection also remains necessary:

- collect ordinary public source data;
- run daily `evidence-run`, evidence reports, AI memos, governance reports, and
  review reports over time;
- accumulate 30/60/90 out-of-sample paper observations before any
  profit/no-profit owner decision;
- update the Phase 13 decision log when evidence changes.

Live execution remains outside the current charter until a future explicit
charter revision.

## Future Operation Instructions

If work continues after Phase 13:

1. Read `docs/project-charter.md` before any new plan.
2. Read `docs/goals/project-completion-goal.md` and follow its Per-Round
   Execution Protocol exactly: Smart Search deep research before design,
   local code-feasibility verification before planning, evidence-first substep
   gates for every meaningful added capability, one Phase per round,
   Superpowers workflows, subagent use, repeated review/fix/re-review cycles,
   state synchronization, a complete Phase report under
   `docs/goals/phase-reports/`, and no next Phase until the current Phase is
   clean, verified, committed, and pushed.
3. Do not start a new product-code phase unless the owner revises the roadmap
   or charter. Current useful work is running the evidence campaign and updating
   review records when new evidence exists.
4. Treat live execution, wallet keys, exchange order routing, private RPC,
   MEV, premium-RPC, and speed-edge paths as blocked unless the owner
   explicitly revises the charter.
5. Use the Phase 1/2 model routing: research/planning/code use the configured
   strong model and report/summary use the configured fast model. Preserve fake
   LLM tests for deterministic adversarial cases, and make real positive tests
   explicit and secret-safe.
6. For Phase 13, review generated reports, evidence packages, AI memos,
   strategy scoreboards, stopped-family ledgers, source-health rows, and
   decision records. Do not add product code or live execution.
7. Keep failed evidence and rejected assumptions in memory.
8. Update this file and `docs/roadmap.md` only when the public roadmap or final
   project state changes.
