# Project Completion State

This file is the working memory for the long-running Codex Goal defined in
`docs/goals/project-completion-goal.md`. Update it at the end of every completed
round.

## Current Round

- Round: 16
- Status: Phase 15 VPS Docker Operations Runtime complete and verified in the
  implementation worktree
- Started: 2026-05-29
- Completed: 2026-05-29
- Active slice: Phase 15: VPS Docker Operations Runtime
- Active plan source:
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-29-phase-15-vps-docker-operations-runtime.md`
- Phase report:
  `docs/goals/phase-reports/2026-05-29-phase-15-vps-docker-operations-runtime-completion-report.md`

## Completed This Round

- Added the Phase 15 design spec and implementation plan for the recommended
  VPS operations shape: Docker Compose runtime plus host systemd timers.
- Added `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, and `docker-compose.yml` for a
  repeatable Python 3.12/uv runtime that keeps `.env`, local worktrees,
  virtualenvs, caches, logs, databases, and `var/` artifacts out of the image.
- Added ops wrappers for daily `evidence-run`, weekly `governance-report`,
  weekly `ai-research-memo`, weekly `iteration-cycle`, monthly
  `rollout-review`, backups, and systemd unit installation.
- Added systemd one-shot services and timers:
  `crypto-alpha-daily.timer`, `crypto-alpha-weekly.timer`,
  `crypto-alpha-monthly.timer`, and `crypto-alpha-backup.timer`.
- Added `docs/vps-deployment.md` with VPS build, `.env`, LLM health check,
  dry-run, timer installation, outputs, logs, failed marker, backup, update,
  and safety-boundary instructions.
- Updated docs contracts, roadmap, runbook, and this state file so the
  operator workflow records that unattended collection is host-controlled and
  still LLM-native.
- Added this round's Phase completion report.

## Verification Evidence

- Baseline worktree verification before Phase 15 code edits:
  `uv run --extra dev pytest -q` passed with 968 tests.
- TDD RED check was observed for missing VPS ops files:
  `uv run --extra dev pytest tests/test_vps_ops.py -q` failed with missing
  Docker, ops, systemd, and VPS deployment documentation artifacts.
- Docker-only intermediate verification showed Docker runtime tests passing
  while ops/systemd/docs tests still failed, then ops and systemd checks were
  brought green incrementally.
- A dry-run compatibility regression was reproduced on macOS bash 3:
  `ops/weekly-review.sh` failed on `declare -n`; a portable dry-run test was
  added before replacing the nameref usage.
- Focused Phase 15 verification:
  `uv run --extra dev pytest tests/test_vps_ops.py tests/test_documentation_contract.py -q`
  passed with 19 tests, then the portable dry-run regression test brought the
  focused contract total to 24 passing checks.
- Full verification:
  `uv run --extra dev pytest -q` passed with 982 tests.
- `uv run --extra dev ruff check .`, `git diff --check`, staged diff checks,
  and staged secret scan are required before commit.
- Staged review before commit is required to include `git diff --cached
  --check`, `git diff --cached --name-only`, `git diff --cached --no-ext-diff
  --unified=0`, and
  `uv run python -m crypto_alpha_agent.security.secret_scan --staged --fail-on-empty-with-untracked`.

## Current Project Target

The prior Phase 13 completion state described a deterministic evidence factory.
The active next project line changes the runtime target: product commands must
be LLM-native and must not succeed through deterministic-only fallback.

The evidence factory now has execution-realistic paper simulation,
evidence-grounded AI research planning, and profit governance review active:

- public-data ingestion and local durable SQLite storage;
- typed OHLCV, funding, DEX, DeFi, and open-interest records;
- source-health records that distinguish route, provider reachability, parse
  status, typed rows, and blocked reasons;
- data-quality checks for source failures, stale records, gaps, duplicates,
  timestamp skew, and invalid values;
- three executable paper-simulated families:
  `funding_extremity_price_confirmation`,
  `funding_mean_reversion_after_extreme`, and
  `funding_open_interest_crowding`;
- three research-only watchlists:
  `defi_yield_regime_watchlist`, `dex_liquidity_volume_watchlist`, and
  `volatility_compression_expansion_watchlist`;
- Phase 10 paper execution realism with venue fee assumptions, min-notional and
  precision feasibility, stale-signal gating, funding alignment checks,
  missed/partial-fill modeling, `pre_cost_only_profitable` rejection, and
  evidence package summaries for notional, fees, slippage, stale signals, and
  fills;
- daily/weekly evidence reports, governance reports, paper simulation, memory,
  and rollout review artifacts with `live_execution_enabled=false`.
- AI research context, stricter experiment proposal guards, duplicate rejected
  experiment memory, design-only strategy template proposals, and weekly
  `ai-research-memo` artifacts.
- Phase 12 `governance-report` artifacts that classify families as
  `keep_collecting`, `stop`, `redesign_validator`, `add_data`, or
  `owner_decision_review` from validation, paper, source-health, cost, and
  memory evidence.
- Phase 7 `historical-bootstrap` artifacts that evaluate historical windows,
  report source collection/probe status, classify historical strategy results,
  and set forward 30/60/90 evidence targets without mutating forward evidence
  ledgers or stopped-family memory.
- Phase 13 read-only review artifacts that inspect generated reports, evidence
  packages, AI memos, strategy scoreboards, stopped-family ledgers, and
  finished artifacts, then record explicit family and major-cycle decisions
  tied to evidence references instead of AI narrative.
- Phase 15 VPS operations layer that runs the LLM-native evidence factory as
  host-controlled Docker Compose jobs scheduled by systemd timers, with durable
  `var/` mounts, latest pointers, failed markers, logs, and backups.

## Known Hard Boundaries

- No wallet keys.
- No wallet-key access.
- No live order routing.
- No exchange order submission.
- No order routing.
- No live execution.
- No live capital.
- No real-capital execution.
- No MEV, mempool, bridge-race, flash-loan, premium-RPC, private
  infrastructure, or speed-edge strategies.
- No secrets in git, logs, docs, memory, reports, screenshots, tests, or public
  GitHub.

## Known Remaining Gaps

The Phase 0 through Phase 15 charter-compliant evidence-factory roadmap is
implemented and verified in the current worktree. The LLM-native runtime
follow-up removed deterministic-only product success paths, and Phase 15 adds
the VPS Docker/systemd operations layer for unattended evidence collection.

Reality audit: `docs/goals/project-reality-audit-2026-05-29.md` records that
the owner's broader autonomy target is larger than the completed Phase 0
through Phase 13 roadmap. Relative to that owner autonomy target, these
implementation gaps remain:

- `iteration-cycle` now starts the closed auto-iteration loop by asking the
  configured real planning LLM for strict `IterationCandidate` records and
  guarding them against uncited evidence, missing tests, missing source probes,
  direct code-write authority, live capital, and live order routing.
- VPS unattended operation is now available through Docker Compose and systemd
  timers, but it only repeats the existing LLM-native evidence/report/review
  jobs and does not create an internal daemon or live execution path.
- autonomous code-writing loop remains proposal-only;
- autonomous new data source discovery remains probe-gated beyond the curated
  source-probe and query catalogs;
- accepted iteration candidates still require human review and separate TDD
  implementation before any source, strategy, experiment, or code-change
  candidate can become product code.

Operational evidence collection also remains necessary:

- collect ordinary public source data;
- run daily `evidence-run`, evidence reports, AI memos, governance reports, and
  review reports over time;
- accumulate 30/60/90 out-of-sample paper observations before any
  profit/no-profit owner decision;
- update the Phase 13 decision log when evidence changes.

Live execution remains outside the current charter until a future explicit
charter revision.

## Future Operation Instructions

If work continues after Phase 13:

1. Read `docs/project-charter.md` before any new plan.
2. Read `docs/goals/project-completion-goal.md` and follow its Per-Round
   Execution Protocol exactly: Smart Search deep research before design,
   local code-feasibility verification before planning, evidence-first substep
   gates for every meaningful added capability, one Phase per round,
   Superpowers workflows, subagent use, repeated review/fix/re-review cycles,
   state synchronization, a complete Phase report under
   `docs/goals/phase-reports/`, and no next Phase until the current Phase is
   clean, verified, committed, and pushed.
3. Do not start a new product-code phase unless the owner revises the roadmap
   or charter. Current useful work is running the evidence campaign and updating
   review records when new evidence exists.
4. Treat live execution, wallet keys, exchange order routing, private RPC,
   MEV, premium-RPC, and speed-edge paths as blocked unless the owner
   explicitly revises the charter.
5. Use the Phase 1/2 model routing: research/planning/code use the configured
   strong model and report/summary use the configured fast model. Preserve fake
   LLM tests for deterministic adversarial cases, and make real positive tests
   explicit and secret-safe.
6. For Phase 13, review generated reports, evidence packages, AI memos,
   strategy scoreboards, stopped-family ledgers, source-health rows, and
   decision records. Do not add product code or live execution.
7. Keep failed evidence and rejected assumptions in memory.
8. Update this file and `docs/roadmap.md` only when the public roadmap or final
   project state changes.
